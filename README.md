# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My journey into software development began in a different setting I was once a factory worker until I was laid off during COVID-19. Since then, I've dedicated myself to transitioning into tech, accumulating almost 3 years of experience as a software developer. Although I don't have decades of experience, I've faced my fair share of failures, and each one has taught me valuable lessons.

I started as a frontend intern, working with React.js, MySQL, and Express, contributing to game projects. This experience built a solid foundation in software development. Today, I thrive as a backend developer, working with technologies like Golang, Python, and TypeScript, and Iâ€™m passionate about building efficient, robust solutions that power modern applications.
